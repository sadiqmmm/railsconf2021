# README

Sample app created for my talk "All you need to know to build Dynamic Forms" at the RailsConf 2021

# Setup
1. Create the database: `bundle exec rails db:create`
1. Run the migrations: `bundle exec rails db:migrate`
1. Run the seeds: `bundle exec rails db:seed`, so to get the sample references Dynamic Form in place

With this you should be able to start the server with `bundle exec rails s` and in the root path you'll see the list of references and the link to go to the new reference page.
